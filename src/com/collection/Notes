Jenkins:

What are servers and why do we need them:
1) Keeps power on all the time
2) Strong internet connection (in GBps) all the time
3) A lot of resources like RAM Disk etc
===========================================================================
1) Developers will develop the code
2) Runs the unit tests if everything goes well, ask the DevOps person to build that code
    and deploy the code on Dev servers
3) Developer verifies that code on Dev server
4) Developer requests DevOps person to deploy it on the integration server
5) Tester will ask DevOps person to deploy the code to QA Server
6) Tester may ask DevOps person to deploy it again on the Performance server, Security testing servers
7) DevOps person deploys application on Staging servers (replica of production servers)
    UAT servers on which UAT is performed
8) To production server

Issues in the manual testing/deployment
1) Time consuming
2) If multiple developers are working, there can be issues in the build and to fix those issues, we may
    need to look at all of the newly added code
3) No automation means a lot of human error
